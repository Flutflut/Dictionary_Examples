# Additional resources
download dictionary.json from https://github.com/matthewreagan/WebstersEnglishDictionary

# Learning Steps
1) Follow datastruct_dict.py to learn how python dictionary objects work
2) Follow through printdict.py to import a json into a dictionary
3) Follow inputoutput.py to take user inputs

# Feature ideas
1) Create a function for handleing dictionary lookups (see functions.py)
2) Handle when the lookup word doesn't exist
3) Handle when the lookup word has different capitalization (tolower_example.py)
4) When the lookup word doesn't exist, return the closest word (difflib_example.py)
5) When the defintion is a single word, look that word up (string_mods.py)(example apogeal)
6) When the definition says "see ..." Look that up too. (string_mods.py)(example phonics)
7) When the definition says "Same as ..." look that up too. (string_mods.py)(example tripmadam)
8) Find a synonym file. Lookup synonyms.
9) Find a english to ... file and translate words
10) Let the user lookup more than one item
11) Let the user add items into the dictionary?
